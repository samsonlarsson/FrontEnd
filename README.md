## BootCamp Day 3 Front-End Development
This repo contains a clone of the Spotiy website Homepage which is build using HTML and CSS.
To make the cloe look more interactive I used Bootstrap and JQuery. 
You will notice that the website does look exactly as the cloned website as I was practising some extra 
customization to indicate the cloning. Below is the structure of the repo;
